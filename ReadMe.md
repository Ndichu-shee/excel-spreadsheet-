-I started a react project that has app.js,package-lock.jason,package.json and spreadsheet.html.

-I used HTML/CSS and JQuery to create the whole assessment.The spreadsheet holds a column from A to Z and Rows from 1 to 50.

-The spreadsheet takes both decimal,negative and positive numbers.The results from the two values is shown on top of the spreadsheet.

-I was able to do the sum and average operations and the results are accurate.It also checks if the input is a strings and returns a Nan since strings and integers cannot work together.
